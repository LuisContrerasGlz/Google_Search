# Google Search

On the Google Search page, there are links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there are a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.

On the Google Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.

On the Google Image Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

On the Google Advanced Search page, the user is able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options):

- Find pages with… “all these words:”
- Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
- Find pages with… “any of these words:”
- Find pages with… “none of these words:”
- Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options are stacked vertically, and all of the text fields are left aligned.

When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user is taken to the search results page for their given query.

“I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link takes users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.

You may encounter a redirect notice when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Not to worry! This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.
